Explanation of Facial Recognition Technology

Face Detection: The process begins with detecting and localizing faces within an image or video frame using algorithms such as Viola-Jones or deep learning-based detectors like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Feature Extraction: Once faces are detected, the system extracts key facial features, often referred to as facial landmarks or keypoints. These features include the positions of eyes, nose, mouth, and other distinctive characteristics.
Feature Encoding: The extracted facial features are then encoded into a numerical representation, often referred to as a facial embedding or feature vector. This encoding captures the unique characteristics of each individual's face in a compact and standardized format.
Matching and Identification: During recognition, the system compares the facial embedding of the detected face against a database of known faces. It calculates the similarity or distance between the embeddings and identifies the individual whose face is the closest match.
Decision Making: Based on the similarity scores, the system makes a decision regarding the identity of the detected face. If the similarity exceeds a predefined threshold, the individual is recognized, and relevant actions, such as attendance logging, are performed.
